/**
 * Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Insertion sort iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
 * It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point,
 * where that element belongs. It does this until it gets to the end of the array.
